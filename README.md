## Dependencies
* [TFOCS](https://github.com/cvxr/TFOCS)
* [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (for the Wasserstein gradient oracle)
* [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) (for an alternative Wasserstein gradient oracle)
* [FastEMD](http://www.ariel.ac.il/sites/ofirpele/FastEMD/code/) (for an alternative Wasserstein gradient oracle)
* [sinkhornTransport.m from Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net/SI.html) (for an alternative Wasserstein gradient oracle)
* ICCSP dataset (details to be filled in)

## Getting started
1. First add the `compute-optimal-transport` directory to the path, as well as any other third party code (e.g. TFOCS)
2. Run `cluster_histograms` which will load the ICCSP dataset and run various clustering algorithms.

At this point, the figures from the paper can be generated by running
* `parse_output`
* `prepare_globe_plots` followed by `make_globe_plots`
